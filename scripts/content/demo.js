/*
Each message node in the dialogue system must include a defined structure to ensure consistent behavior and rendering.

Required and Optional Fields:

1. type (string) — One of the following six message types:
   - "plain"        → Standard text message.
   - "image"        → Image from URL.
   - "embed"        → Pop-up embed from URL.
   - "tex"          → Pop-up TeX render.
   - "dialogue"     → Dialogue-based user options.
   - "mcq"          → Multiple-select MCQ (can select more than one).
   - "single-mcq"   → Single-select MCQ (only one correct option).
   - "text"         → Open-ended text input.

2. content (string)
   - For all types except "image" and "embed": The message text (can include LaTeX).
   - For "image": Image URL.
   - For "embed": Embed URL.

3. next (string) — [Required for all types except "dialogue"]
   - ID of the next node to load after this one.
   - For MCQ types, this is triggered after optional feedback responses (see `respondToIdx`).
   - Not required for:
     - "dialogue" nodes (use `respondToIdx` instead),
     - final message nodes,
     - intermediate response messages.

4. important (boolean) - [Optional]
   - If true, pre-emptively marks a message as important (can be viewed in Starred)

5. delay (number) — [Optional]
   - Delay in milliseconds before showing this node (defaults to 250ms base delay for smoothness).

6. options (object) — [Required for "dialogue", "mcq", and "single-mcq"]
   - A dictionary mapping option keys (typically numbers) to display labels.

7. answersIdx (Set<number>) — [Required for "mcq" and "single-mcq"]
   - A `Set` containing the keys of correct answers.

8. respondToIdx (object) — [Required for "dialogue", optional for "mcq"/"single-mcq"]
   - A mapping of selected option keys to follow-up node IDs.
   - For "dialogue", this is mandatory and determines branching.
   - For MCQ types, it optionally provides feedback nodes for selected options.

9. answers (Set<string>) — [Required for "text"]
   - A set of accepted correct text answers (case- and space-insensitive matching is applied).

10. marks (number) — [Optional for "mcq", "single-mcq", and "text"]
   - Maximum score awarded for correctly answering the node.
   - System message will display score after answering.
   - Scoring is skipped if this is undefined.

11. previewText (string) - [Optional for "embed", "tex"]
   - Preview text for the pop-up message.
   - Defaults to: 'Click to open embed' ("embed") or 'Click to open page' ("tex")

12. backgroundImage (string) - [Optional for "embed", "tex"]
   - Preview image URL for the pop-up message.

13. preload (boolean) - [Optional for "embed"]
   - Preloads the embed, and the same embed will be reused for future messages with same URL and preload=true.

14. sticker (boolean) - [Optional for "image"]
   - Displays the image with no outline.

15. systemMessage (string) - [Optional]
   - Sends a system message with the specified text immediately after the message.
