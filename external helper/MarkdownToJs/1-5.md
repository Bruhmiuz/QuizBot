## Intro Start from beginning

### plain

Let's consider the following equation. 

$$\begin{array}{}
        x &-&     y & &  &=& 0 \\
        ax &-&    y &+& z &=& 4 \\
        ax &-&    ay &+& a-2 &=& -4 \\
\end{array}$$

This is a linear system of equation in terms of $x$, $y$, $z$. $a$ here is a constant. The goal here is to solve for $x$,$y$,$z$ and express it in terms of $a$

### plain

How do we even begin approaching this? Let's start by putting it into an augmented matrix.

$$\left( 
    \begin{array}{ccc|c}
        1 & -1 & 0 & 0 \\
        a & -1 & 1 & 4 \\
        a & -a & a-2 & -4 \\
    \end{array}
\right)$$

### plain

Recall from 1.4 - we try to reduce the matrix to a simpler form - REF or RREF, because these forms allow us to more easily derive the answer.

### mcq

Which row operations make sense to be carried out here?

* $R_2 - aR_1$
* $R_3 - aR_1$
- $\frac{1}{a}R_2$ 
- $\frac{1}{a}R_3$  

### plain

The first two help us make the row $2$ column $1$ and row $3$ column $1$ turn into $0$. As for why the other two don't work, what if $a=0$? what is division by $0$? 

<strong>Remember - whatever row operation we do must work for all $a$</strong>

## WrongBackSub _NOCHECKPOINT

### plain 

Applying these operations, we get the matrix:

$$\left( 
    \begin{array}{ccc|c}
        1 & -1 & 0 & 0 \\
        0 & a-1 & 1 & 4 \\
        0 & 0 & a-2 & -4 \\
    \end{array}
\right)$$

The above matrix looks like it's in REF! Let's back substitute!

### dialogue WrongBackSub1

Let's solve for $z$

- $(a-2)z = -4 \implies z = \frac{-4}{a-2}$
    - WrongBackSub2
- hold on...
    - CasesStart

### dialogue WrongBackSub2

Let's solve for $y$. Substitute $\frac{-4}{a-2}$ into $(a-1)y + z = 4$

- $y = \frac{4 - \frac{-4}{a-2}}{a-1} = \frac{4}{a-2}$ (simplification ommitted)
    - WrongBackSub3
- something feels wrong...
    - CasesStart

### dialogue WrongBackSub3

Let's solve for $x$. Substitute $y = \frac{4}{a-2}$ into $x-y = 0$

- $x = \frac{4}{a-2}$
    - WrongBackSub4
- something is very wrong...  
    - CasesStart

### dialogue WrongBackSub4

We solved it! Let's verify our answer - if $a=2$, what's the value of $x$, $y$ and $z$?

- oh no...
    - CasesStart

## Cases _NOCHECKPOINT

### plain CasesStart 

You might notice if $a=2$, we're dividing by $0$! Actually it's not just that, there's a deeper problem here. Let's look again the matrix:

$$\left( 
    \begin{array}{ccc|c}
        1 & -1 & 0 & 0 \\
        0 & a-1 & 1 & 4 \\
        0 & 0 & a-2 & -4 \\
    \end{array}
\right)$$

### plain

Let's take a look at several cases of values for the matrix:

$$a=1 \implies \left( 
    \begin{array}{ccc|c}
        1 & -1 & 0 & 0 \\
        0 & 0 & 1 & 4 \\
        0 & 0 & -1 & -4 \\
    \end{array}
\right)$$
$$a=2 \implies \left( 
    \begin{array}{ccc|c}
        1 & -1 & 0 & 0 \\
        0 & 1 & 1 & 4 \\
        0 & 0 & 0 & -4 \\
    \end{array}
\right)$$
$$a=3 \implies \left( 
    \begin{array}{ccc|c}
        1 & -1 & 0 & 0 \\
        0 & 2 & 1 & 4 \\
        0 & 0 & 1 & -4 \\
    \end{array}
\right)$$
$$a=4 \implies \left( 
    \begin{array}{ccc|c}
        1 & -1 & 0 & 0 \\
        0 & 3 & 1 & 4 \\
        0 & 0 & 2 & -4 \\
    \end{array}
\right)$$

### plain

Can you see that the staircase of zeros is different for each of them? When $a=1$, the $a-1$ term turns into $0$. When $a=2$, the $a-2$ term turns into $0$. 

Recall from the process for reducing to REF or RREF, looking at where the $0$s are is very important for determining the next step. Hence, we shouldn't blindly apply the algorithm, unless we are very sure that the unknown terms aren't $0$.

### mcq

So, when are we sure the unknown terms aren't $0$?

- When $a \neq 1$
- When $a \neq 2$
* When both of the above statements are true

### mcq

If $a \neq 1$ and $a\neq 2$, the above back substitution formula would work! But what if $a = 1$ or $a = 2$?

* We can handle those seperately!

### plain

Let's look at $a=2$ first.

$$a=2 \implies \left( 
    \begin{array}{ccc|c}
        1 & -1 & 0 & 0 \\
        0 & 1 & 1 & 4 \\
        0 & 0 & 0 & -4 \\
    \end{array}
\right)$$

### plain

The last row is saying that $0x + 0y + 0z = -4$, which is not possible! Hence if $a=2$, this system is inconsistent.

### plain

Now for $a=1$

$$a=1 \implies \left( 
    \begin{array}{ccc|c}
        1 & -1 & 0 & 0 \\
        0 & 0 & 1 & 4 \\
        0 & 0 & -1 & -4 \\
    \end{array}
\right)$$

### plain

Taking $R_3 + R_2$, we get

$$\left( 
    \begin{array}{ccc|c}
        1 & -1 & 0 & 0 \\
        0 & 0 & 1 & 4 \\
        0 & 0 & -1 & -4 \\
    \end{array}
\right) \xrightarrow[]{R_3 + R_2} 
\left( 
    \begin{array}{ccc|c}
        1 & -1 & 0 & 0 \\
        0 & 0 & 1 & 4 \\
        0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
    \end{array}
\right)
$$

### plain

This is already in RREF! (this is a coincidence by the way, it's usually not this convenient)

The pivot columns are $1$ and $3$. We can let the non-pivot column (corresponding to $y$) be the parameter $s$.

Our answer will be: $x = s, y=s, z = 4$, for any real number $s$

### plain
Hence, 

If $a=2$, we get no solution. 
If $a=1$, we get infinitely many solutions with one parameter
Otherwise, we get a unique solution that can be expressed in terms of $a$

Isn't that interesting?


### plain

Remember the purpose of REF and RREF algorithms are to simplify matrices into a form that we can solve more easily. However, we sometimes cannot proceed because we don't know if some term (e.g. $a-1$, $a-2$) is $0$ or not.

In such situations, we should split into cases. If we assume a value of $a$ that makes some term $0$, we proceed to solve that specific case. Otherwise, we can proceed normally, since we have the assurance that every term containing $a$ is non-zero.

### plain

That being said, the above is just the general principle. There's no hard and fast rule, so practice more and you'll get the hang of it :)

### plain

That wraps up 1.5, congrats for making it to the end of chapter 1!
